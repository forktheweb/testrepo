We strive as maintainers and contributors to uphold certain values for our project, [CrateKube](https://github.com/cratekube/cratekube). We've spelled this out in a handy-dandy acronym: **CREATIVE**.  We strive for our team to be [Collaborative](#Collaborative), [Respectful](#Respectful), [Efficient](#Efficient), [Accountable](#Accountable), [Transparent](#Transparent), [Iterative](#Iterative), deliver outstanding [Value](#Value), and be as [Effective](#Effective) as possible.  Creativity is the juice that keeps us flowing.

# Collaborative
Being helpful to other members of the team is paramount.  If someone asks for help with the project, we should always provide guidance in our respective areas of expertise.  

### Assume Good Intent
Always assume that the contributors and maintainers of this project have good intentions.  Toxic conversations happen mostly from the lack of emojis and bad faith.

### Trust but verify
Everything that goes into a release must be code reviewed, and quality assurance is always provided by persons _not_ on the review.  If code is merged and Q&A finds some small edits, open a separate issue for them.  Always trust that people are finding the right solutions, but verify they are being implemented correctly.

# Respectful
Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

# Efficient

# Accountable

# Transparent

# Iterative

# Valuable

# Effective
This value is broad, and it is meant to be.  Being effective at inflencing others, writing good code, leaving good reviews, and being a compassionate human being are all good examples.

### Give feedback effectively
Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
