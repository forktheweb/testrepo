We strive as maintainers and contributors to uphold certain values for our project, [CrateKube](https://github.com/cratekube/cratekube). We've spelled this out in a handy-dandy acronym: **CREATIVE**.  We strive for our team to be [Collaborative](#Collaborative), [Respectful](#Respectful), [Efficient](#Efficient), [Accountable](#Accountable), [Transparent](#Transparent), [Iterative](#Iterative), deliver outstanding [Value](#Value), and be as [Effective](#Effective) as possible.   

# Collaborative
Being helpful to other members of the team is paramount.  If someone asks for help with the project, we should always provide guidance in our respective areas of expertise.  

### Assume Good Intent
Always assume that the maintainers of the project have

# Respectful

# Efficient

# Accountable

# Transparent

# Iterative

# Valuable

# Effective
This value is broad, and it is meant to be.  Being effective at inflencing others, writing good code, leaving good reviews, and being a compassionate human being are all good examples.

### Give feedback effectively
Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
