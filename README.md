# Introduction
This document serves as the source-of-truth for Crate Security Architecture standards. The table of security standards is defined as follows:
| Property  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Identifier  | A integer representing the standard. Must be unique among all Crate Security standards  |
| Short Name  | A snake_case short name of the standard. Must be unique among all Crate Security standards and no longer than 10-characters. May be used instead of the numerical identifier in diagrams.  |
| Category  | One of "authc", "authz", "trust", or "audit". Defined as: <ul><li>authc - Authentication standard</li><li>authz - Authorization standard</li><li>trust - Trust relationship standard</li><li>audit - Auditing standard</li><li>confidential - Confidentiality standard</li></ul> |
| Strength  | The relative strength of the standard for informing design decision preferences. One of "avoid", "weak", "sufficient", "strong". Defined as:  <ul><li>very weak - Do not use this standard unless no better alternative standard exists. It is considered insufficient.</li><li>weak - If a stronger standard is available, use it instead</li><li>sufficient - A suitable standard for most user cases with a balance of implementation complexity and utility</li><li>strong - The strongest standard available but may not be suitable for all use cases depending on implementation complexity</li></ul>  |
| Expiration  | The date when the standard must be reviewed and renewed or superseded by a new standard.  |
| Superseded By  | The numerical identifier of the standard that has or will replace the standard.  |
| Description  | A complete and accurate description of the standard technical, process, and people elements. A technical criteria section may also be present with a of criteria with requirement level as defined in defined in RFC 2119 <sup>1</sup>  |

# Referencing The Standards
Security standards should be referenced in diagrams or documents using the regex pattern of `\[((?[a-z_]+):(?\d+))|(?[a-z_])\]` such as `[cisco_sso]` or `[authc:100]`. The short name is preferred whenever it provides better readability.
